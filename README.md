# Emoji Search Index

This project contains a set of translated search tags for many popular emoji. We use these lists of tags to facilitate emoji search in our Signal clients.

The index is a combination of two data sources:
- Annotations from Unicode [CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr) project.
- A set of custom tags we've created ourselves.
